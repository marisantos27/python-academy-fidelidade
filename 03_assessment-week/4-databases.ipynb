    "A [**database**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) is a **organized collection of data**. In particular, we are interested in databases supported by a database-management system (**DBMS**), think MySQL or Oracle. DBMS provide an interface to perform various management operations, like creating databases, storing and updating data, creating tables, managing users and a lot more. When we talk about databases, we are often referring to the combination of the actual database and the corresponding DBMS."

    "On the other side we have **non-relational databases** that may vary in how they store data (e.g. key-value, document, graph). These are also referred as **NoSQL** because they are based in other query languages. Key advantages include that they are **often fast** and **do not require fixed table schemas**. The choice for a particular NoSQL is much **more dependent on the problem** it must solve. The **data structures** used by NoSQL are different from relational databases and include a wide variety of structures (e.g. key-value, document, graph, wide column)."
